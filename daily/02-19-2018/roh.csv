7yq7zg;[MAIN SPOILERS] This small moment that nobody talks about might've been one of the sweetest and most touching moments between these two.;"When Tyrion proposes speaking with Cersei alone after the Dragonpit meeting didn't go well after Jon publicly swears allegiance to Dany in front of Cersei, and Dany is the only one out of everybody who protests in him going to talk to Cersei out of fear she'd kill him.

I felt this small moment had an emotional impact to it for a few reasons. First off, I can't remember one time in the show where someone was against the idea of Tyrion doing something dangerous that he could die. Nobody has been as overprotective of him as Dany has. Despite the mistakes he made in Season 7, she wasn't giving up on him and still needs him.

It was also her choice of words too that really stood out; ""I didn't come all this way, to have my Hand murdered."" She has lost loved ones she cared about on her journey to get back to Westeros, had just came back from losing her child beyond the Wall, and now she's possibly going to lose her close friend, someone she has formed a very special bond with. They had their troubles, but underneath all of that she still deeply loves and cares about him to the point where he is like family to her. 

Tyrion didn't want everything they went through to try and get help from Cersei for the Great War by showing proof that the WWs exist to be for nothing, so if he had to risk dying especially since this was his idea, then so be it. Because if he didn't at least try, then 'they're right back where they started.', it was so sweet that Dany didn't want that from him. But she understood, respected and appreciated that, so she reluctantly accepted he had to do this. The only good thing that really came out of it, was that at least with Tyrion getting Cersei to publicly promise to help, this won Jaime over to his side and now has valuable information on what Cersei is really planning.

This moment I also felt really mirrored the scene where Tyrion begged her not to go to Eastwatch, only this moment felt a little more powerful because at least we see that their feelings are mutual. They're both very protective of one another from being hurt, and can't stand the thought of one of them dying. I love how the show handled filming both scenes, where they kept the cameras focus on both Dany and Tyrion in the two separate scenes as they watch the other leave.";gameofthrones
7yq6f9;Data Science vs Software Engineering;"I am currently debating between a career in data science and one in software engineering.

It seems to me that data scientists are first and foremost... exactly that: scientists. They ask questions and seek answers. So, fundamentally, what makes a good data scientist is a knack for asking the right questions and knowing where to go look next once they've received an answer.

On the other hand, software engineers are concerned with designing and building software. So, a fundamental quality of a software engineer is a knack for good, solid (aesthetic?) design, optimization, readability of code, parsimony of code.

Data scientist embrace messiness and derive meaning from it; software engineers embrace structure and use it to build.

Is that an accurate assessment?

Finally, how much engineering does go into data science after all?";datascience

7ypncv;Data Science Foundations and Specializations;"I am a relative newbie to the world of Data Science; I'm 60% of the way through the U-Mich intro to applied data science in python course on Coursera.  Because I'm going through the self-taught MOOC route, I'm struggling a bit with what my next step should be once I finish the U-Mich 5 course series.

I've read a fair number of posts, articles, and comments that point out that the fast evolving nature of the field prohibits anyone from being familiar with all topics.  Given that, what would you see as the foundational skills for someone interested in Data Science; those skills that anyone in the field would need to have?  Once the foundation is laid, what are some of the common routes of specialization within Data Science?";datascience

Data science is a huge field of knowledge and I am not sure what I would like to specialize or work in the future.  My final degree project was about Sentiment Analysis which was an interesting field of study too. 

Right know I am wondering what skills/software/frameworks are required to start working in a good/decent company as soon as I get the master's degree. What have you guys worked on? What kind of companies are you in? Any experience/recommendations are very welcome, I would like to get some feedback from people with experience in the real world, right now my environment is purely educational..

7yle5s;Hiring Data Scientists;"I’m currently in the process of building out my business lines data science function. I was hoping I could get a couple of pointers as historically I have only hired for pure quant roles. Specifically:  
* Where is best board to post the role to? Our company only posts to LinkedIn and our website by default which isn’t particularly targeted.  
* What questions or exercises do you think give the fairest reflection of an interviewees skillset?  
* For those with limited practical experience – what factors do you think are good indicators of genuine skill/passion?  

For the context, the role is in London, junior VP level in finance though very open to a non-finance background. It should have good pay and interesting work.

I am not looking for an exhaustive list though, but it would be great if someone can throw light on some important and obvious variables.

Also, after identifying these variables, what data mining techniques are deployed to finally flag transactions? Any additional information is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.";datascience

7yk2ml;[EVERYTHING] A Twist for a Certain character;"Okay so let's face it when Jon gets North with Daenerys I don't think the North is going to take to kindly too him bending the knee, I even bet Sansa may not be too happy to this but a lot of people think Arya will support Jon bending the knee and while I think she still loves Jon and she may respect Dany I think she will still definitely have a problem with Jon bending the knee, Maybe not as much as everyone else but I think she will have issues with Jon bending the knee for four reasons.

1. Starting in no order Arya would still see (like the other Northerners) Dany as the Mad King's granddaughter I.E the man who killed her grandfather and Uncle.

2. Arya would also have a problem with Varys being there as she saw her in the tombs of KL and also if Jon and Bran forgive Jaime.

3. Jon may also try to make Arya stay in WF and not fight due to him maybe being alittle overprotective for obvious reasons.

4. Really think about it from Arya's POV (Ironically) if she found out Jon was king and to find out she gave it to a foreign woman she never even met and also is the granddaughter of a mad man she would be furious and could see her relationship with Jon as taking Jon away from the Wolfpack, Yes I think like Sansa she could grow to like Dany more but personally I think she will still have a problem with Jon bending the knee. ";gameofthrones
7yjtjo;[EVERYTHING] Question about Arya and Sansa;"In Season 7, Sansa is talking to Baelish about how ""Arya might betray her if she thought she would turn on Jon."" (Misquote--something along those lines).

Why does Sansa assume she knows Arya? They literally haven't seen each other since Season 1. They've each had transformative experiences that have completely changed their character and outlook, and it seems pretty clearly evident in their other conversations. Unless Sansa was trying to throw Baelish for a loop, the Arya - Sansa relationship in Season 7 makes little sense.

Why would there even be perceived tension between them? Am I missing something?";gameofthrones

7yiq17;Advice for career and help with a foot-in-the-door opportunity;"I work in a role extracting data and producing simple stats.  I want to up my game and move a bit towards modelling and making predictions based on our data.  Two questions:

1)  I already have some tech skills, is it better to choose specific projects and learn on the job, or should I be doing some online courses to get theory down before attempting to apply the skills?

2)  I have an opportunity that might just get me a job if I can figure out how to model it.  I would like to describe the process below and hopefully someone can give me pointers on how to get started. 

There are essentially 3 counts:  A count of what comes in at ""A"", a count of what goes out at ""B"" (can go from B to C or from B to D), and the counts that go in at C or D.  C or D can be considered together or separately (they are 2 divisions within the second tier of processing)  Not everything that comes out of B will go on to C or D, but only the flow to C/D is relevant to this model.  It is a simple flow with 2 levels of processing.  

There are 14 data types for what comes in and goes out.  All this happens over time (about 3-8 months from in at A to out at B, then about 4-6 months until back in at C or D).  

I want to be able to chart/predict when there might be a big peak or drop coming at the C/D in point, for any of the 14 different data types.  The lag in time is what has got me stuck.  I have been using simple financial year groupings but perhaps they are just too wide given the time period for the flows.

Hopefully that makes sense.  Can anyone help me out?

I should add that I use excel or SAS (but only for basic things).

Thanks in advance";datascience
