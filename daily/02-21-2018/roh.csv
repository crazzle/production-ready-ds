7z9g6u;Imposter Syndrome as Data Scientist;"I've been working as a Data Scientist with a Consultancy company in various domains - Bioinformatics, IOT, and Pharma - for nearly three years. 
After reading up on a lot of posts here, I feel I should know much more by now. I've been testing the job market and have passed some interviews but they were not with large companies known for analytics. 

Is there any guide or handbook which lists all the things one should know as a Data Scientist? I have been using this, but it only scratches the surface: http://www.itshared.org/2015/10/data-science-interview-questions.html#mathematics";datascience
7z9djd;How much vacation time do you get?;"For people who work in the Data Science realm (Data Analysts, Data Scientists, even Data Engineers), how much vacation time do you get? If you get unlimited vacation time, how much time would you feel comfortable taking? How much sick time do you get? How many holidays?

I searched /r/cscareerquestions and was able to get a sense for how much vacation time Software Engineers get, but couldn't find any similar information here. The O'Reilly Data Science Salary Survey also didn't include any vacation information.

I can start. I am a Data Scientist in the Seattle area. I get 4 weeks PTO, unlimited sick time, and 12 holidays that are not floating. ";datascience
7z9ais;Am I punching above my weight with these Kaggle challenges? (xpost /r/cscareerquestions);"So I'm trying to transition into the data science field. I took a 3-month data science boot camp in late 2016, and on top of that, I've taken some online courses on machine learning.  

Specifically, I went through Stanford's CS231n (Computer Vision) and CS224n (Natural Language Processing) that they posted online. For those of you who don't know, Stanford's CS department basically posted all the lecture notes, assignments, and lecture videos for those two courses online so that regular people (even non-Stanford students) could go through them. Admittedly, I already knew a lot of the material they posted, and it seemed like much of those courses were sort of a cursory look at what modern day researchers in those fields are doing.  

I decided to try my hand at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) Kaggle challenge. Specifically, it's an image segmentation challenge, and image segmentation is one of the topics CS231n touched on. I tried my hand at it and wasn't really able to get above the 10th percentile of submissions.  

I tried to look at what some other people were doing and I was shocked. I mean, these people were writing thousands of lines of code and writing incredibly complex models. It seemed like they really knew what they were doing and had a purpose to doing it. They seemed like actual CV researchers. Me, on the other hand? I was kind of just blindly fumbling around. I mean, my model was, like...50 lines of code total and pretty rudimentary.  

So I'm wondering if I'm kind of out of my depth here with some of these Kaggle challenges. Are they just meant for people with more knowledge of these topics? Are they meant for actual researchers and CV scientists, as opposed to people who just went through some courses online? Or am I just going about this challenge all wrong?  ";datascience

7z918e;[MAIN SPOILERS] Jon Snow did lie;"In S07 in expedition beyond the wall, Jon tells Jorah: ... *Lord commander Mormont thought you never come back to westoros.* 

This is a lie. Jon knows it. Jorah knows it.

But in S07 again when he could lie ""just a bit"" to Cersei for much more important matter of dealing with NK and his army, he refuses to lie.

The difference is: the first time he lied because he thought (maybe) Jorah want to have his honor back (kind of) and the second time he didn't lie because of his own honor.

So: in GoT a character can lie if honor demands. The true meaning of ""honor"" seems complex in GoT. It is certainly a mix of selfishness, judgement of people (after you), involving promises or not, ...

Still: a lie is a lie.

What do you think about the meaning of ""honor"" in GoT?";gameofthrones
7z8umr;New Intern - Questions on Predictive Maintenance;"So I just landed a data science internship at a robotics company, which I'll be starting in the next couple of weeks. It looks like one of my first big projects will be on predictive maintenance (specifically on building a monitoring system for their existing models) and I wanted to get a head start. Searching my school's databases has done okay at becoming familiarized with some of the basics of PdM, but I'm wondering if anyone can help with some of the details. 

I'm not too familiar with the specifics of the data just yet, but we essentially have a stream which collects data on the position of each axis of each robot, as well as a few other attributes (I want to say current flowing through each axis? Torque? Something like that). From what I understand the models are essentially unsupervised, as its cost-prohibitive to allow failures to occur.

Anyway my three main questions are:


* 1. How would I go about creating a feedback loop for PdM?
* 2. What metrics could be used - if the data is unsupervised like I  suspect it is, then obviously accuracy/precision/recall/f1 are out. My guess so far would be to use uptime/downtime, or some sort of dollar savings relative to preventive maintenance instead of predictive. 
* 3. How best to visualize these. I'm guessing this monitoring system is intended to be client-facing, so on top of developing understandable metrics it will be important to have useful visualizations. Also interested in knowing what kinds of tools are companies using to produce these visualizations.

Thanks in advance for any help or advice. If anyone with experience in PdM can direct me toward any especially helpful papers/atricles I would really appreciate it!";datascience
7z8q24;Struggling Data Analyst;"Hi all. I recently graduated uni and I've been working at my first job at a startup in SF doing a mix of product data analysis and marketing data analysis. 

After about 5 months of working here, one of my biggest struggles has been being able to validate if the underlying data seems to look correct. I do a lot of query writing with SQL and get my queries validated from time to time but there appears to be inconsistencies between what my boss expects the results to be and what they are. I am one of the only ones at my company doing this and there isn't always a clear point of truth. 

I understand that data validation and accuracy is an integral part of this industry, but I feel very overwhelmed with the expectations at times. I feel as though I am a bit more junior for my role. Is this a normal feeling for an entry level candidate?

My boss is not happy with the inconsistencies and I feel that I am going to be let off soon simply because I haven't delivered up to his high expectations. I definitely want to improve but I just don't know what more I can do. I really enjoy working with data but feel lost and frustrated at times by the lack of clarity. Any advice would be much appreciated.";datascience
7z8l8t;From Chemical Engineer to PhD?;"Hi All,

Looking for some advice on my approach. I'm 29 and have hit of a bit of cross-roads in my life. I spent the last 7 years in industry, pursuing a lot of cost-reduction, continuous-improvement, quality improvements in the manufacturing sector. I have a few inventions and patents and papers on my resume but it looks more like an MBA candidate then a PhD candidate right now... but!

I love the data part of my job. The analysis, the problem solving using data. I'm totally self taught, but considered the best at my company at what I do. I want to do more of it and I don't want to go down a career in management. I don't care about the money and so I'm thinking of going back to school for an applied statistics PhD. I love learning (spend all my free time learning and reading) and think I'd enjoy the process of a PhD.

So far, I see three paths to get where I want to be. (Solving and researching problems in our world with data)

-Take GRE's this summer, apply to PhD. programs for 2019.

-Take a Masters in Math/Statistics for 2 years, then apply to PhD. programs. (Don't really want to do this because of cost)

-Self teach myself everything and do kaggle competitions and get hired on as a data scientist somewhere.

Is a PhD a possibility for me? Is a masters necessary before I apply? (I am extremely self-motivated and a skilled self-teacher) Can I compete as a Chemical Engineer graduate from top-40 school (graduated high honors with an A in Linear Algebra..) against all these math/stats people?";datascience
7z8g1g;[EVERYTHING] Does anyone else think Arya's presentation in S1:E1 is counterintuitive to her development as a character?;"I've recently decided to rewatch the first season of GoT, at the same time as rereading the first book of ASOIAF, and I have to say, Arya's representation in the show really bewilders me. For example, Arya's is literally introduced as a warrior already, outshooting Bran with a bow, even as he is guided by his two older brothers. For me, this scene really took away a sense of transformation in the character of Arya. 

After all, if Arya was allowed to practice shooting a bow to the point of outshooting her brother, hasn't the identity of Arya already been established? Why would her Lord father/ the rest of society look so negatively on her attempts to break gender norms, when these norms have clearly already been broken? How can Lord Eddard rationalize prohibiting her from yielding a sword when surely he was already aware of her ability with a bow?

Has this scene struck anyone else as slightly odd? In addition, can anyone else think of other examples in which Arya's journey has been weirdly contradicted like this?";gameofthrones
7z7zqt;Usual hiring timeframe;"Hello, 

Can anyone with experience give their view on when is a good time to apply for data science jobs with mid-sized companies? How many months in advance is ideal? At career fairs I've received feedback from some companies that now is too early for a Sept 2018 start date, yet at the same time my friends who chose to work with the big four as research scientists or software devs already have closed their offers. 

I don't know if I'm wasting my opportunities applying online to companies I haven't been able to meet in person or contact. I've sent messages to recruiters where applicable asking this question but have received very few replies. I'm nervous because I will need to start working as soon as I graduate and stop receiving my small stipend, and I obviously would want to start working in my intended career right out of the gate.

I'm graduating with an MSc Computer Science in August 2018 in Montreal, Canada. I've already been turned down by one mid-sized company after getting quite far in the hiring process. I suspect a small part of the reason they didn't hire me was because my start date was so far in advance.

My thought was I would never spoil anything. For example, I’m not gonna bring up R+L=J until he pieces it together himself when they show the Tower of Joy. 

I dunno, just looking for suggestions and insight. I’ve been trying to get him into the show for years, and it’s almost weird to try to explain things without explaining too much. You have to be able to discern which moments are ambiguous to the point of needing explanation and which moments are vague on purpose (he was confused why winterfell was burned in S2, and I almost gave the whole thing away).

7z7d5m;[MAIN SPOILERS] - The Night King's 'heritage';"Hey everyone,

I know there are many theories about the Night King and stuff, but...

Well, I was re-watching GoT and it just hit me, when Bran took over the 3ER's role in the story. I kept on thinking about that and the connection to the NK.

Could that be possible that the Night King is actually not a single person but rather a 'title'? I mean something similar to Bran/3ER type of incarnation or so. Then, it seems pretty understandable the Night King would also need some 'succesor', who must probably have some strong talents/powers, similar to Bran, perhaps even king's blood (which Starks have, as they were first Kings in the North) What if all the boy 'sacrifices' actually were meant to find 'the true succesor'? I doubt all the boys survived to become the WW's (perhaps?) and the Night King might still be 'searching'.

And one more thing. Could that be possible 3ER is also some kind of a 'weapon', created by the CotF?

What do you think? Is that even possible?";gameofthrones

7z22c6;OFF TOPIC: WHAT TO DO ABOUT GOOGLE SEARCHES;"Hi guys, there's a website which hosts my ABN information which used to be on the third page, which is now the FOURTH result when you google my name. Some girl who I had a fight with on tinder sussed out my facebook profile and got a guy to write a ""comment"" on this website saying I'm a huge woman abuser, there's a huge collection of me abusing women online, and I'm unfit for work and renting to.

This wouldn't bother me as much (because its complete bullshit) if I didn't know for a FACT HR is going through this and probably either getting turned off by me or having some questions.

I have no idea how to handle this. I've tried contacting the site admin who ignores me, I've tried contacting the company who handles the comment system and reporting the comment, all to no avail. In fact its probably half my problem that this is now the 4th site that comes up when you google me.

I'm quite distressed about this and wondering what the hell to do. I'm currently getting background checked by a company and to have to explain this is hard. Not to mention the HR people that do the research are the type to take this shit really seriously.

And kind words of wisdom or advice are very appreciated";datascience

I just want some feedback or recommendations. Which one should i do if i want to do some kaggle competitions once im finished.";datascience
7z0mvi;For Time Series Analysis, is it ok to automate?;So I just finished the chapter in my TSA book going through the theory of PACF, ACF, and there generating functions of back shift operators and their coefficients. The main theme seems to be to remove trend, look at PACF/ACF and decide MA/AR terms, with some look at the generating functions to determine if the time series is invertible. Is this right? Also, it seems like there are packages that automate this process looking at PACF/ACF values and selecting terms based on whether the value is higher than a confidence interval, straight up giving you a model for free, and even telling you the difference coefficient. Is it considered safe to let a software package automate this process as long as you verify the PACF/ACF and GF coefficients and agree the model selection was reasonable?;datascience
