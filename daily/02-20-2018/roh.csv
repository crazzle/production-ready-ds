7yy3hx;How smart do you have to be to become a Data Scientist?;"Hey r/datascience,
I am currently a junior in undergrad majoring in a field that I would describe as a science and technology hybrid. The major focuses more on having knowledge in multiple areas, developing team skills, and project management. During our senior year we develop a capstone related to our concentrations. Most graduates from this program go on to become consultants at big firms, but that isn't really where I want to go.

My education has exposed me to Python (no in-depth OOP, but I have been exposed), some SQL, R, Access, and Excel. I have done basic coding but nothing on the level of what CS Majors do. I'm currently taking Thermodynamics II, and have taken an intro stats course, also currently taking a simulation and modeling course where statistics are used to model systems. I enjoy math, but am worried that I have not been exposed to the more difficult levels of math I always hear when data science is being discussed.

That being said, I am considering going to graduate school for data science. For those of you who have a Master's or PhD, is this higher level of education basically a necessity in order to get a job as a data scientist? Is the math required for the data science field difficult to master? I'm sorry if these questions are vague. I appreciate any feedback on this topic.";datascience

Jon Snow: Warrior (millitary commander, has won many battles)

Tormund Giantsbane: Father (keeps talking about having children with Brienne, talks about having sex a lot in general)

Gendry: Smith (trained as a smith)

Jorah Mormont: Maiden (obsessed with beautiful younger women, Daenerys as well as his ex-wife Lynesse)

Thoros of Myr: Mother (the ability to give life)

Beric Dondarrion: Crone (gives knowledge, near death but still alive)

Sandor Celgane: Stranger (obsessed with death and killing)

7yx6pu;[Main Spoilers] How Game of Thrones Argues Against Nihilism: A Thematic Analysis;"“Valar Morghulis,” “Valar Dohaeris.” 
 
The common greeting-response couplet from the continent of Essos is exactly the kind of unimportant small detail that authors only include to give glaring hints at the deeper thematic meaning of their story. The phrases translate to “All men must die,” and “All men must serve.” I chose this detail, but I could have easily taken the motto of the Drowned God “What is dead may never die!” or the tenets of the Many Faced God’s religion which demands his followers become “no one,” to introduce the idea: Game of Thrones is thematically centered around Existentialist philosophical questions. 
 
Existentialism argues that whatever forces the external world uses to pressure a person, there is still always room for choice on that person’s part. No matter a person’s role as an employee, they can choose to defy the orders of superiors and possibly be fired for example. “I was just following orders,” is the worst excuse one could give to an Existentialist. These ideas are applicable to rejecting social expectations based on categories like race, gender, and social class in order to choose one’s own path. Even one’s own past and prior actions should not be viewed as a restraint on present action. An implication of this fundamental idea is that your choices are ultimately totally your own responsibility and therefore are revealing of the truth of your essence, what you really are, arguably something that can be labeled as a spirit or soul; and in this way living life can be viewed as a process of self-discovery. It doesn’t take much to see how these ideas about personal essence connect to political ideas of freedom of choice for individuals and abhorrence of slavery and stereotyping.  
 
And these are all themes we see at the forefront of Game of Thrones. The drama of the female characters’ struggles with their gender roles is thoroughly explored in several characters and plotlines, but also Samwell’s struggles with his father’s expectations of him and the few thousand eunuchs running around in the story explore masculine gender roles. Class roles are explored in characters like Jon Snow and Ser Davos, Knight of Onions, both of whom are in the running for Most Noble Characters in their respective Main and Supporting character weight classes, and both of whom at least technically were commoners early in life. There is bigotry against Wildlings on the part of the people of the Seven Kingdoms, and the cultural expectations of the Free People for the behavior of Southerners is similarly constrained. Jorah and Theon address issues of histrionics and self-perception from prior actions. There are too many examples to enumerate them all. Even so, issues of socially constructed identity are only one facet to this problem, and arguably a minor one. 

Existentialism goes much farther than the impositions of people on oneself and argues that any imposition from the external universe should be held separate from our responsibility for our choices. With respect to our opening couplet, “All men must die, All men must serve.” George RR Martin is pointing to the many occurrences in his world where characters are faced with choices of the form: “Do this action or greatly imperil your life,” Frequently in his world if you are acting in accordance with self-preservation you are likely not serving your own internal will and desires, but are likely bowing to the will of forces outside of oneself. Similarly, if one is truly imposing one’s will on the external universe it is almost necessarily an act of sacrifice, most potently of one’s own life. The use of the word “must” in the couplet is ironic because normally it signifies lack of choice, but by using it twice there is a suggestion that both are possible and that perhaps choosing among the options of service and death is also possible. Of course this choice is exactly the kind of choice Existentialist philosophers view as importantly revealing of The Self, despite the potential threat of death on one side of the choice. It seems much of Game of Thrones is about how choosing to greatly imperil or even outright end one’s life may in fact be the superior option. 
 
Qhorin Half-Hand asking Jon Snow to kill him in front of the Wildlings in order to help Jon Snow is a case where a character was choosing to die. Now granted, Qhorin was probably only giving up some views of the scenery and an opportunity to be tortured to death by sacrificing himself in a mock fight with Jon, but even this can be viewed as a microcosm of the choices for self-sacrifice. Yes Qhorin was going to die much sooner than others faced with a choice of dishonorable action or temporary life extension, but if say Robb Stark just sat and did nothing at the death of his father one could argue that the remainder of his life would likely be as empty and meaningless as Qhorin’s march to inevitable painful death through the bleak northern wilderness (even if he retained power personally and fathered children, eventually his dishonoring of his familial obligations may set a precedent that results in the crumbling of the house and eradication of the Stark name). Tyrion’s choice to lead the defense of King’s Landing at the Battle of the Blackwater may have been a similar choice of likely immediate death versus a slightly postponed death, but this didn’t stop Joeffry from being tempted to cower in hiding. Or if Jon Snow didn’t take his last best shot to retake Winterfell despite the risks, if Hodor didn’t sacrifice himself to hold the door, if Sam had allowed Gilly to be raped by the other Night’s Watchmen, if Ser Davos didn’t stand up on several occasions to dutifully offer a contradicting opinion to his Lord, their lives may have been meaningless marches to a slightly postponed death.  
 
But even more than simply being an occasionally correct and valid option, the metaphysics of Game of Thrones makes sacrifice into an inverse of service whereby sacrificing allows one to impose more of their own will on the world. This is clearly illustrated by the necessity of blood sacrifice to the workings of most types of magic (with the possible exceptions of warghing and greensight, but weirwood trees are strongly hinted to be at least partially dependent on human remains for nutrients), most dramatically perhaps with the birth of the dragons. Less directly, the willingness of Jon Snow to sacrifice himself for the Freefolk at Hardhome created a strong bond of loyalty with them; by pursuing the alliance with the Freefolk to the exclusion of other possibilities, notably the possibility of internal cohesion of the Nights’ Watch and his own continued mortal existence he concentrated enough willful energy to bring the alliance into existence. Ultimately I would predict the story will play out to show that the noble self-sacrifice of Ned Stark was much more effective at achieving his goals than other characters, possibly most importantly Cersei. Particularly, he will be shown to be more successful at the goals of the endurance of his family, the perpetuation of his cultural values and traditions, and being remembered favorably. 
 
And in doing so Martin is definitively breaking with a Nihilistic world view. This may be a surprising assertion considering the copious levels of mayhem, gore, and general chaos in the story coupled with the apparent complete silence of the various deities. A writer friend of mine told me he received a note from an executive instructing him to make a script more like Game of Thrones. When I asked him what that meant he said “It basically meant to make all the characters be dicks to each other for no reason.” But Martin gives his world a Justice mechanism which gives us insight into the reasoning of the deities of Game of Thrones, Martin chief amongst them. 
 
R’hllor and the Drowned God have an opposite approach to the existential questions of the show but share a lack of moral direction on the choices faced by their adherents. The Lord of Light encourages his followers to burn brightly, signifying the Existentialist view that some possibilities must be sacrificed or burned in order to enhance the potential for other possibilities, specifically the possibilities that are expressing the inner desires of the follower. The Red God would probably encourage courageous acts of self-sacrifice made for great causes. The Drowned God exhorts followers to let go of ambition, and goes in a more Buddhist direction calling for an end of internal desire and realization of the power loss-of-ego gives. He probably would frown on self-sacrifice for a cause, but he also would frown on over-attachment to life, as both things imply caring about something. (I think the Iron Islands is what happens when as a society people try to respond to every societal problem or issue with “I don’t give a shit,” it is a land where possession is ten tenths of the law after all.) I don’t think either of these deities or religious belief systems have any particular issue with someone pursuing an evil life either because they want to or because they don’t care to be good. Just be passionate about being evil to appease the Red God or be completely apathetic towards good to appease the Drowned God.  
 
The faith of the Seven and the religion of the Old Gods in the North give more moral guidance. The Old Gods don’t seem to have a religious text, but their religion largely consists of prohibitions against various dishonorable acts (and rituals associated with trees). The faith of the Seven basically outlines six general categories of valid pursuits and a seventh “None of the above,” category which essentially represents making an invalid choice. I have heard it argued that The Seven all represent Death, and that is in some sense true, but there is a Yin kind of dying and a Yang kind of dying; with Yang you are projecting your will into the world with Existential authenticity, with Yin you are not. 
 
The faith of the Seven is the most heavily developed in the show and it serves as a sort of categorization of Martin’s views on the primary motives of characters. Each of the six “good” or ""Yang"" deities represents some role or motive that many of the characters in the show are fulfilling or trying to fulfill and which is worth sacrificing time and physical safety to achieve. The Father represents maintenance of values and the social order. Ned Stark and Tywin Lannister would represent attempts to fulfill this role through most of their in show plotlines (attempts: Ned seems to be more successful). The Warrior represents change of values and social order and could be represented possibly by a young rebel Ned Stark, Arya or Brienne of Tarth. The Smith represents work and sometimes applied wisdom more generally. Tyrion, Samwell, and possibly occasionally Daenerys represent this role in their plotlines. I've heard it argued that The Smith and Work represent servitude but this is incorrect. Who was Gendry serving while he forged his own armor? The labor of Tyrion and Varys to hold the world together similarly represents authentic choices on their parts; they aren't being forced to be advisors to rulers and likely have the means to live leisurely quiet lives if they chose to. The Mother represents nurturing the young and leaving literal genetic descendants, and obvious instantiations of the role include Cat Stark and Cersei, but arguably Ned Stark fulfills this role as well in his plotlines. His hiring Arya’s fencing instructor leaps to mind in particular. The Maiden represents beauty, being well liked and being good company. Sansa is the most constant portrayal of this role, but Tyrion actually of all characters has a very interesting relation to this existential goal that reveals insight in Martin’s view on sexuality. Tyrion is a character who for a very long time is frustrated by his inability to be liked or romantically loved. The Crone represents transmission of wisdom and is most clearly represented in Olenna Tyrell’s character, although Maester Aemon and the Three Eyed Crow are other good examples. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive. Clearly characters can flow from one role to another, and give commentary on a role which is secondary to a more primary role for the character. 
 
And then there is the “None of the above,” choice. The Stranger represents doing things which will ultimately endanger yourself and your family, bring harm to your society, weaken its institutions, and reduce its ability to self-maintain, and bring infamy on you and your name. He represents Yin. While these could theoretically be life goals and represent an Existentially valid choice if the choice is made authentically, this is not often the case (one could say it would be strange to desire these things). You would have to hate the world very much in a basically completely suicidal and possibly spiteful way. That said, Tommen is a good example of someone who really does make an active choice to end his life for basically that reason, feeling as though all his other volitional power had been taken from him. Enslaved people also may want to exercise this option authentically. But most of the time characters fulfilling the role of the Stranger are not doing it on purpose. Stannis was trying to play the Father, but did so ineptly and wound up being the Stranger. From a pure Existentialist view point you could argue his decisions were valid: the Existentialist would say “He pursued his ambition to the end. He died knowing he did everything he could.” R’llor would be proud. Six of the Seven at least would not be. 
 
The Good Six of the Seven represent life goals echoed in the Stark family motto “Family, Duty, Honor.” These are the life choices and goals which Martin wants to assign a positive value. Goals of preserving DNA are associated with Family and the Mother; transmitting culture and values to the future is associated with Duty and the Father, Smith, and Warrior; being well-liked and remembered as good is what is meant by Honor and is clearly associated with the Maiden. The Crone floats over the whole thing and is responsible for resolving disputes when, for example, being liked conflicts with disciplining your children. 
 
While straight up ineptitude exists (perhaps best embodied by the character Edmure Tully) and can land you in the role of the Stranger, this doesn’t tell us much about Martin’s Justice engine. A more interesting question is why Cersei has been such a failure in her role as Mother when others like Cat Stark have been successful (or will presumably be shown to have been successful by the conclusion of the series)? Isn’t Mother one of the good goals? 
 
Cersei is brutal. Martin points to this many ways, but simply put: The Mountain is her physical reflection, physically ugly where she is physically beautiful, physically powerful where she is physically weak, but spiritually they are similarly brutal. Brutality in this Existentialist language of choice and desire means to pursue your own authentic desires, as Existentialists would always encourage, but to do so without due attention and consideration to the desires of others and their ability to make choices that further their goals, disempowering others more than necessary. This pursuit of one’s own goals without care for others is perhaps most forcefully represented in the act of rape, a motif that occurs frequently in the show. Cersei’s reflection The Mountain is one of the more notable perpetrators of this crime. 
 
(I’m only doing this in an aside because I want to keep talking about the mechanics of Martin’s Justice engine, but… 
 
One Existentialist view is that our existence is something that actually is forced upon us by the universe or G-d or nature or whatever. Now at [nearly] any moment one could reject this thing being forced on us, but just the fact you’d have to go through the trouble of committing suicide, for some Existentialists, makes existence tantamount to rape. But, even though you weren’t previously consulted about the universe you were being created into, you still can take control and live authentically. This character arc is basically how rape is used for Daenerys in season 1.) 
 
So what is so bad about frustrating the pursuits of others? The metaphysics of Martin’s Existentialist universe point to the idea that by pruning away some possibilities, other possibilities necessarily gain strength. When you prune away the potential to fulfill goals from others, they gain increased ability to fulfill other goals, specifically revenge on you for harming them. Olenna Tyrell illustrated this nicely in the last episode of season six. After the death of her entire family she was free to pursue revenge with complete abandon, even at the cost of her life or her house’s power. If you dishonor a person’s culture and traditions, destroy his ability to learn, kill his family, make him despised, and prevent him from transmitting his wisdom in his old age, then there is nothing (literally nothing, you took Father, Smith, Mother, Maiden, and Crone roles from him in Martin’s language, the Stranger literally represents nothingness and non-existence and he is all that remains besides the Warrior) between him and assuming the role of the Warrior to change you and your position of power. This means all the volitional energy that would have gone into all the other five existence-oriented goals goes instead into a revenge-focused Warrior. 
 
We see this perhaps best illustrated in Arya’s plot line. If she were fettered by the continued existence of her parents she would likely be groomed for a diplomatic wedding and a life away from Needle. Now she’s a cruise missile of revenge. She has none of the attachments to others in the Six of Seven, like Jon did to the Father when he was obeying the tradition of adherence to his oath to the Nights’ Watch, or Robb did to the Maiden when he married his true love, or Sansa does to the Maiden and femininity, or Cat Stark had to the Mother with her freeing of Jaime (it is hard to think of good examples for Crone and Smith, but Aemon Targaryan may be a case where they were chosen over the Warrior). But more potently, the origins of the Faceless Men were in slavery, and this lack of choice is what gave them mystical power to overcome their masters.  
 
So this is how GRRM argues against Nihilism in his work. This means that there is no possible “evil” prefix for the Mother or any other role. If you try to be evil while being the Mother you only end up generating an overwhelming self-defeating counterforce from the revenge you empower. You end up self-defeating, just a very specific kind of inept that will likely lead to fulfilling the Stranger’s role. GRRM seems to use some Taoist symbolism with Dragons representing forces of Yang and Tigers/Manticores representing the force of Yin (I have to credit The Order of the Green Hand youtube channel for pointing this out). This justice mechanism seems to suggest that Yang can be ""overshot"", leading back into Yin and implying that there is morality in his universe.";gameofthrones
7ywxes;Looking to create a confidence metric when binning regression predictions for an ordinal classification problem.;"I'm working on an ordinal classification problem where the target classes are actually low cardinality (<10) continuous values (think -1.25, .5, 2.35, etc). Since these are ordered and the classes can be changed in the future (e.g. the class corresponding to 2.35 can later be adjusted to 2.5). The number is used in a different business application. The current solution is to implement a regression model and bin the outputs to map back to classes. The model isn't incredibly accurate (~45% simple accuracy compared to low 50s when using a multilabel classifier), but the flexibility of tuning the bins for business purposes is a key factor. 

I'm trying to come up with a confidence metric that will accompany the prediction to the end user. Currently I'm thinking of creating a confidence interval and if this interval overlaps into another bin noting this. However most of the distributions of each class are quite dispersed so this would almost always be the case.

I've also thought about taking the distance from the midpoint of the bin and normalizing it over the length of the bin. Or perhaps doing the distance from the median prediction of the true class, although this is future info and could prove to be an inaccurate metric.

Any ideas or feedback would be appreciated.";datascience

7ywpdc;[Everything] Why none of the stark Children can have kids and what it means for the endgame.;"This is just a theory, and I'm sure its been talked about before but I just started thinking about it recently. What if a few events that were kind of confusing to the story happened only for the purpose for the Stark children to not be able to have kids. Heirs are such an important topic in this show and who will rule who will rule what when its all over.


- Ive heard of Paraplegic's having children but its not that common. Bran falling from the tower and everything that happened to him could have still happened (being the three eyed raven etc.) if he had the use of his legs. I think it was done just so he couldn't produce an Heir but we don't know that at this time. I read somewhere were Ned even said he couldn't have them in the book. 


- We wondered why didn't Arya didn't die from her stab wounds, and it seemed to be just a pointless plot line since she came away from those injuries completely fine in like one episode. If you really pay attention to it though, she is stabbed multiple times in the gut so it seems to me, there is no way she will ever be able to have kids after that. I think it was done by the directors only for that reason and we will find out later. 


- The rape of Sansa, and ""he hurts me every night"" was done to show she cant potentially have kids if she was injured bad enough for how ever long she endured all of that. After everything she may not even wants kids anyway. 


Point is, the only Stark left that can have kids is Jon but he is a Targaryan. Could it be revealed that he is the only one that can further the stark line so he chooses to remain a stark instead of a Targaryan. Potentially keeping his parentage a secret because of this. So any child by him and Danny would be a stark. the last of the Starks. If not the Stark name will just die out. Maybe that's just part of how the end game goes, no more starks and maybe that's what the Night King wants really. Or like another theory I have everyone will die and the baby of Danny and Jon will be turned into a white walker and be the Next Night king. I don't know it's all just theory like everything else, but it is plausible and something to think about. ";gameofthrones

Just to give you some background, I got into data science while in college. Completed an online course to start off with and have been fascinated ever since. Worked on quite a few passion projects involving machine learning. Badly wanted to work as a data scientist after college. However, I wasn't at a great uni and there were no recruiters from analytics/data science at the career fair. Applied to a lot of places but barely got any responses and 0 interviews. Finally settled on a job as a web developer to pay the bills. I initially continued working on my data science projects in my free time. Unfortunately, my work hours became hell and I haven't had much time to get proper sleep, leave alone pursue my interests. However, I did mention my interest to  friends/contacts/family in the hopes of getting an opportunity. Recently a former colleague of mine called me. She mentioned that the firm that she works with is opening a Data Sciences and Analytics division and that they are looking for applicants. Apparently, they are looking for experience in R and machine learning specifically.  I have worked extensively in R during college and I don't think it will take me much time to brush up my coding skills in the same. However, I have been completely out of touch with algorithms and statistics. Could the good folks here kindly suggest me some resources where I can brush up my knowledge of data science (machine learning in particular), preferably from the ground up? This is my first opportunity at a data science job and means a hell of a lot to me. Please do help a brother in need. ;datascience
7ysvp8;[MAIN SPOILERS] I want these two characters to meet at least one more time;"Cersi and Sansa. 

They have both gone through so much since they last seen eachother, and Sansa has even said herself that she learned alot from Cersi. I think it would be a great interaction. ";gameofthrones

7ystzb;[EVERYTHING] A Theory on Bronn;"Now I know there are a lot of theories on who Bronn is, But I personally believe that he is none other then the brother of Roose Bolton and that he left to the Night's Watch after deciding that his family was not worth being with as he was disgusted by what they stud for and what they do, Now as for why he left well I believe it could be since house Bolton was never really that loved (especially the stuff Ramsey did to Northern women (Sick Bastard)) that he would probably not last too long so he deserted and made his way to the Vale and made up the story of being a Sellsword at the wall doing work, Though it is also possible if this was years ago that he left to be a Sellsword and when he return North for work, he decided to leave because maybe something when wrong or he was no longer needed but didn't want to return home so he went to the Vale.

Okay so why would Bronn be a Bolton didn't that house have a history of being violent and liking Torture, Well yes but I think with Bronn it could be a Ugly Duckling story as in he is not like the others. In this case Bronn may not have been as violent or extreme as his brother Roose or his Nephew Ramsey and we know he is not a Rapist and knows no means no (atleast I hope he does), Okay so now for actual evidence...Well I don't have a lot but I have some for one it explains why he is at the Wall in a sense, Him not revealing who he is could because to protect himself as there are some out there who my want to kill something with the last name Bolton, We don't know much about House Bolton, and Finally he does kindof look like a Northern.

Okay so to be honest I don't really have a lot of evidence but I do think it would be an interesting twist.";gameofthrones

7yslo8;[EVERYTHING] Night’s Watch when all is said and done;"A thought occurred to me and I haven’t seen it on the list of theories so I thought I’d see what others thought.

We’ve often discussed the “and now his watch is ended” and that Jon’s death and subsequent resurrection released him from his Night’s Watch oath and sets him up to be king.

But what happens to the Night’s Watch if the foes they were founded to combat are wiped out? And the wall that is their post is gone?

*IF* (and I realize it’s an if) the WW are all defeated and Jon remains alive, what is to stop him as king (or queens consort even) from having the brothers of the NW released from their oaths because their reason for being is now over?

Suddenly the roasting of the Tarlys is more than just an example of Dany’s ruthlessness. Sam’s position restored, he could re-take House Tarly.

Maybe I just see too much in the little things and nuances.";gameofthrones

7yrq74;[Main Spoilers] GOT seasons 5-7 are such a sharp decline from prior seasons, it’s crazy;"I just went back and watched seasons 1-4 and man they are just much better written and paced. Characters suffered the consequences for their decisions and felt the weight of their choices. Storylines were developed and crafted very carefully with care and consistency. The world was brutal and unforgiving plus the nature of the political strife had a very real effect on the 7 kingdoms. 

Seasons 5-7 has become dumbed down. like there being absolutely zero political ramifications for Cersei killing the tyrells and the high sept plus tons of innocent people. Or the death of little finger being an absolute travesty in the way it was executed( he doesn’t demand a trial by combat? He doesn’t mention the lack of evidence in all of Sansas accusations? He doesn’t hall ass once bran repeats the “chaos is a ladder” line back to him? He is a lord, does he not have the right to demand a proper trial? Just awful)  or Sansa keeping the army of the vale a secret from John Snow without any consequences for their relationship? Or Tyrion of all people suggesting that they should kidnap a wight in order to convince Cersei to help in the battle against the night king even though he knows how she deceitful she is and the only assurance they have is her word? Also characters like Tyrion,Varys and Petyr have all been incredibly dumbed down, it’s like the writers don’t know what to do with them

I really hope they don’t release season 8 until they have really through the storyline and make everything believable but I doubt that’s gonna happen 

I’m just a little disappointed that the prime of this show is over and now they’re very clearly just going through the motions in order to finish it off. Not how I imagined this show would end.";gameofthrones
7yrg0s;What will be more useful to learn, Java or C++?;"I'm going to be taking core CS courses (Intro to CS I and II, data structures, algorithms, etc) and am wondering if any language will be more beneficial to me career wise. Is one language favored for a data scientist / ML engineer?

&nbsp;

I'm already pretty good with R and currently getting better with python. So all else being equal, is there an advantage to learning C++ vs Java? What are the pros and cons?";datascience
